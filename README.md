# MyRefri - project2

A main purpose of this application is to track the date of foods inside our refrigerator. After we shop foods at a glocery store and put them in the refrigerator, we sometimes forget what we have in there later. Some foods stay in the refri for a long time, and we buy same foods again without eating previous ones. So, this app allows users to write the first date putting the foods in the refri and the expiration date of foods so we can track what we have and the freshness of foods.
